This project is my first full ML pipeline using Amazon SageMaker!  
The goal is to automate a customer churn prediction workflow using:

- Data preprocessing
- Model training with XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning (HPO)
- Model registration
- Clarify explainability & bias analysis

Some steps failed during execution due to instance limitations in my AWS account,  
but the pipeline structure and logic are in place! So far, happy with how much is working and how much Iâ€™ve learned.
